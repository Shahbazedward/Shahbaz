    <h2><b>MOUNTAINS</b></h2>
    <p>Mountains are of different types and are known by their range. Many mountains consist of a series of parallel ranges extending over hundreds of kilometres. The Himalayas, the Andes and the Alps are mountain ranges of Asia, South America and Europe, respectively. Mountains vary in height and shape.
        There are mainly three types of mountains:</p>
       <ol><li><b>Fold Mountains:</b> These are created where two or more of Earth’s tectonic plates are pushed together. <br>
        Example: The Himalayan Mountains in India and the Alps in Europe. The Aravali range in India is one of the oldest mountain ranges in the world.</li>
        <li><b>Block Mountains:</b> These are created when large areas are broken and displaced vertically. <br>
        Example: The Rhine valley and the Vosges mountain in Europe.</li>
        <li><b>Volcanic Mountains:</b> These are formed due to volcanic activity. <br>
        Example: Mt.Kilimanjaro in Africa and Mt.Fujiyama in Japan</li></ol>
        <h3>Importance of Mountains</h3>
       <p>Mountains are very important for the ecosystem. They are a storehouse of water. Many rivers have their source in the glaciers in the mountains. With the help of these mountains, reservoirs are made, and the water is harnessed for the use of people. The water from the mountains is also used for irrigation. It is also used to generate hydroelectricity in hilly areas. Most of the area covered by mountains is green as a wide variety of flora and fauna is found here. So, these mountains provide fuel, shelter, fodder and other products like gum, raisins, etc. These mountains help in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem.
        Mountain as an Attraction for Tourist and Adventure Activities
        Mountains are a very popular and attractive destination for tourists. Especially in summer, people like to go to hilly areas with their family and friends. They spend their vacation relaxing in the lapse of the mountain. The scenic beauty of mountains makes their eyes shine and refreshes their mind, which ultimately gives them peace. The mountains are also liked by young people. They like to come here and do adventure activities. Some of the popular activities are paragliding, river rafting, bicycling, trekking, hang gliding and skiing.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>XMountains are a global heritage. So, it’s important that we conserve these mountains and the natural diversity of these mountain regions. Since these mountains have become the favourite destination for tourists, many people visit these places. Due to this, construction is increasing in these areas. The mountains are cut down to make roads and many other such activities. The result of that is landslides, soil erosion and change in the pattern of the monsoon. To avoid all these things, we must ensure that the development of the hilly area should be done in a sustainable manner. So it does not hamper the growth of nature</p>
